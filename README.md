# Face-Mask-Detector
In my last semester I along with my team had the opportunity to work on a soft computing project, we decided during the COVID-19 pandemic it will be really helpful to make a fake mask detector

## Dataset
We were able to the dataset on Github prepared by Prajna Bhandary that consisted of 1376
images, 690 face images with masks, and 686 without masks:
